## Project Overview

- Uses numbers, symbols, lowercase and uppercase
- Input the code into the website for the user to see the generated password

## Tools used in creating the generator
- Javascript

## Issues resolved
- ALOT!

- Then had to made a statement that randomized the said code so that each variation of the tool was random and not repeated
